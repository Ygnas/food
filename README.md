## Git Approach
Feature Branch Workflow, I use separate branch for each feature. It allows me to work independently and isolate the changes from the develop and master branch. It also facilitates code review and testing before merging the branches. All the work is being done in feature branches merged to develop branch, and all the releases are made from master branch as there is no development inside it.
